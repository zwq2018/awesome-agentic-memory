> **Why memory?** An LLM's context window is its short-term memory — fast, fully attended, and gone the moment the window clears or overflows. Everything an agent should *remember across time* — facts about a user, past conversations, learned skills, evolving state — has to live **outside** the window and be selectively retrieved back in. That problem — what to store, when to retrieve it, how to update it, and how to forget — is **agentic memory**. This list maps the entire space.

## TL;DR — Start Here

New to the space? This is the shortest path to competence:

1. **Read** [Lilian Weng — LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) (the memory section) and the [CoALA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427) for vocabulary.
2. **Understand the two camps**: *hierarchical paging* ([MemGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) → [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)) vs *temporal knowledge graphs* ([Zep/Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)) vs *extraction pipelines* ([Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)).
3. **Run something**: [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) (easiest drop-in) or [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) (full stateful-agent platform).
4. **Benchmark it** against the field's standard trio: [LoCoMo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17753) + [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) + [BEAM](https://mem0.ai/blog/ai-memory-benchmarks-in-2026).

> ⚠️ **A note on benchmark scores throughout this list:** memory benchmark numbers are *heavily contested* — they swing wildly with config, judge model, and harness. See the [Zep ↔ Mem0 dispute](https://blog.getzep.com/lies-damn-lies-statistics-is-mem0-really-sota-in-agent-memory/) before trusting any single SOTA claim. Treat vendor-reported scores as vendor-reported.

## Taxonomy of Agentic Memory

### The CoALA frame

The accepted scaffolding comes from **[CoALA — Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)** (Sumers, Yao, Narasimhan & Griffiths, 2023). It models any language agent as three parts: **memory**, an **action space** (internal reasoning + external tools), and a **decision procedure**. Its memory typology is lifted straight from human cognitive science (Tulving's episodic/semantic split) — which is why Letta, Mem0, LangMem, and Zep all map their features back to the same words.

```mermaid

      Working scratchpad

      Consolidate / Reflect

      Knowledge graph
      Hierarchical paging
      Summarization buffer
```

### Short-term vs long-term

| | Short-term / working memory | Long-term memory |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** | *Inside* the context window | *Outside* the window (vector / graph / SQL / files) |
| **Lifetime** | One reasoning episode; volatile | Persists across sessions; effectively unbounded |
| **OS analogy** ([MemGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560)) | RAM | Disk |
| **Constraint** | Finite token budget | Retrieval quality — agent only sees what gets pulled in |

The central engineering problem is **context management**: deciding which slice of a huge long-term store gets loaded into the small working set, and when. Letta and Anthropic both call this *context engineering*.

### Long-term subtypes (the cognitive-science mapping)

| Subtype | Human analog | In an agent | Stored as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Episodic** | Memory of specific events | "What happened" — interactions, traces, outcomes | Event/episode summaries, past trajectories |
| **Semantic** | General world knowledge | "What is true" — user facts, preferences, entities | Vector-embedded facts, KG triples |
| **Procedural** | Skills / how-to | "How to act" — rules, workflows, skills | Editable system prompt, code, skill libraries |

A widely cited refinement (LangMem) is the **distillation hierarchy**: raw episodic experiences distill into semantic facts; repeated semantic patterns crystallize into procedural rules. Memory consolidates *upward*, specific → general, over time.

### Memory operations (the lifecycle)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I[Interaction] -->|encode / extract| W[Write to store]
    W --> S[(Long-term store)]
    S -->|retrieve: vector / graph / recency| C[Context window]
    C --> R[Reflect / summarize]
    R --> S
    S -->|consolidate + dedup| S
    S -->|forget / decay / supersede| S
    C --> I
```

- **Encoding / writing** — extract what's worth keeping (fact/entity extraction, salience scoring). Runs *hot-path* (synchronous, during the turn) or *background* (async — LangMem, ChatGPT's "dreaming").
- **Retrieval** — vector similarity, BM25/keyword, hybrid, graph traversal, recency. Generative Agents scores by **recency × relevance × importance**.
- **Forgetting / decay** — TTL/expiry, recency decay, relevance pruning. Keeps the store from growing unbounded.
- **Consolidation** — merge, dedup, abstract raw memories into higher-level ones (episodic → semantic).
- **Reflection / summarization** — synthesize higher-order insights ("reflections"); **compaction** = summarize-and-reinitialize a near-full window.
- **Updating / conflict resolution** — revise memories when facts change. Good systems mark old facts *superseded* rather than silently overwriting — this is where **temporal reasoning** matters (Zep's bi-temporal graph is the reference example).

### Memory architectures

| Architecture | How it works | Strength | Weakness | Reference impl |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vector RAG** | Embed memories, retrieve by similarity | Simple, ubiquitous | Weak at structured/temporal reasoning & conflicts | Pinecone, Chroma, pgvector |
| **Knowledge / temporal graph** | Entities + relations as a graph; bi-temporal validity windows | Best for temporal reasoning & conflict resolution | More infra, extraction cost | [Graphiti / Zep](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) |
| **Hierarchical paging (LLM-as-OS)** | Core (RAM) / recall (cache) / archival (cold) tiers; agent pages data in/out via tools | Illusion of unbounded context; agent self-manages | Latency of tool-call paging | [Letta / MemGPT](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) |
| **Summarization buffer** | Rolling summary of old turns + verbatim recent window | Cheap, easy | Lossy | LangChain buffer memory |

Production systems usually **combine** these — e.g. Redis for session state, a vector DB for semantic recall, Postgres for episodic/procedural, a graph for relations.

### Long-context benchmarks (related)

These test long **context-window** retrieval, *not* persistent cross-session **memory** — a distinction worth keeping straight.
